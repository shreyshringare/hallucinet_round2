"""
25 hallucination detection samples across 3 difficulty levels.
Every sample passes the 6-test checklist:
  1. Exact phrase pointable in llm_response
  2. Objective — numbers, names, dates only
  3. No external knowledge needed — reference is sole source of truth
  4. hallucinated_phrase is exact substring of llm_response
  5. Instant agreement — no hesitation
  6. 3 people would agree unanimously
